# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Attention! 
Install node_modules before running the program. 
When you run the application, queries may not work because the api does not work correctly. Reload the page several times or wait a few seconds. 
To go to the details page, you need to hover over the block with the post and there will be a link to the details page.

All the conditions of the test task were met (I had to learn TypeScript in those 48 hours and apply the knowledge ;) )
